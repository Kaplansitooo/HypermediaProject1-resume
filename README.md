The structure of the website follows a linear and centered layout, making it easy for users to explore key information step by step. The header introduces the identity of the user (“Var IanKaplan = Computer Science Student”), mimicking a programming variable declaration to reflect a technical background.

Below the header, the logos section displays key programming languages and technologies (C++, Java, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Docker, PHP, Git), acting as a quick visual overview of technical proficiency.

The introduction section combines a profile image with a short paragraph describing personal motivation and problem-solving mindset. This is followed by a download button, allowing users to easily obtain a PDF version of the resume.

The final and main part of the page is the interactive circle section, which replaces traditional text sections with an engaging interface. Each circle corresponds to a different content area — Academic Background, Work Experience, Languages, Contact, and Profile. Hovering over a circle dynamically replaces the central image with detailed information, enhancing the interactive user experience while maintaining simplicity and clarity in navigation.
