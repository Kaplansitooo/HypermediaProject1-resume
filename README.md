Information Architecture:

The structure of the website follows a linear and centered layout, making it easy for users to explore key information step by step. The header introduces the identity of the user (“Var IanKaplan = Computer Science Student”), mimicking a programming variable declaration to reflect a technical background.

Below the header, the logos section displays key programming languages and technologies (C++, Java, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Docker, PHP, Git), acting as a quick visual overview of technical proficiency.

The introduction section combines a profile image with a short paragraph describing personal motivation and problem-solving mindset. This is followed by a download button, allowing users to easily obtain a PDF version of the resume.

The final and main part of the page is the interactive circle section, which replaces traditional text sections with an engaging interface. Each circle corresponds to a different content area — Academic Background, Work Experience, Languages, Contact, and Profile. Hovering over a circle dynamically replaces the central image with detailed information, enhancing the interactive user experience while maintaining simplicity and clarity in navigation.


###Visual Design:

The visual design is based on minimalism, clarity, and interactivity, combining soft pastel tones with strong typographic contrast. The main color palette uses shades of green and mint (#9BD2B2, #5CA283, #6CBFA3) to evoke calmness, balance, and professionalism while aligning with a nature-inspired aesthetic.

Typography is handled through two custom fonts: “Title-Font” for headers, providing a distinctive identity, and “Text-Font” for body content, ensuring readability and coherence. Rounded shapes and subtle shadows are applied consistently across buttons and circles, conveying a sense of modernity and friendliness.

Interactive feedback plays a crucial role: hover effects slightly enlarge elements without shifting their position, emphasizing precision and control. The central “HOVER A SECTION” prompt and image encourage users to explore intuitively. The background remains neutral to avoid distraction, while dynamic elements (like the typing animation in the header and the content transitions in the circle section) bring life to the design.

Overall, the visual composition successfully integrates design aesthetics with technical symbolism, expressing both creativity and programming competence—ideal for a computer engineering student portfolio.
