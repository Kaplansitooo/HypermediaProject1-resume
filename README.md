Information Architecture:

The structure of the website follows a linear and centered layout, making it easy for users to explore key information step by step. The header introduces the identity of the user (“Var IanKaplan = Computer Science Student”), mimicking a programming variable declaration to reflect a technical background.

Below the header, the logos section displays key programming languages and technologies (C++, Java, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Docker, PHP, Git), acting as a quick visual overview of technical proficiency.

The introduction section combines a profile image with a short paragraph describing personal motivation and problem-solving mindset. This is followed by a download button, allowing users to easily obtain a PDF version of the resume.

The final and main part of the page is the interactive circle section, which replaces traditional text sections with an engaging interface. Each circle corresponds to a different content area — Academic Background, Work Experience, Languages, Contact, and Profile. Hovering over a circle dynamically replaces the central image with detailed information, enhancing the interactive user experience while maintaining simplicity and clarity in navigation.



Visual Design:

The visual design is based on minimalism, clarity, and interactivity, combining soft pastel tones with strong typographic contrast. The main color palette uses shades of green and mint (#9BD2B2, #5CA283, #6CBFA3) to evoke calmness, balance, and professionalism while aligning with a nature-inspired aesthetic.

Typography is handled through two custom fonts: “Title-Font” for headers, providing a distinctive identity, and “Text-Font” for body content, ensuring readability and coherence. Rounded shapes and subtle shadows are applied consistently across buttons and circles, conveying a sense of modernity and friendliness.

Interactive feedback plays a crucial role: hover effects slightly enlarge elements without shifting their position, emphasizing precision and control. The central “HOVER A SECTION” prompt and image encourage users to explore intuitively. The background remains neutral to avoid distraction, while dynamic elements (like the typing animation in the header and the content transitions in the circle section) bring life to the design.

Overall, the visual composition successfully integrates design aesthetics with technical symbolism, expressing both creativity and programming competence—ideal for a computer engineering student portfolio.


The website is primarily designed for professionals and recruiters who might come across Ian Kaplan’s profile through platforms such as LinkedIn. These users are typically individuals working in the technology or human resources fields, often seeking young, talented developers or students with creative potential.

User Persona:
Meet Laura Gómez, a 30-year-old technical recruiter at a mid-sized software development company in Barcelona. Laura often reviews portfolios and academic projects from university students to identify potential candidates for internships or junior developer positions. She has limited time to explore each candidate’s work, so she values clarity, concise information, and appealing design.

When visiting Ian Kaplan’s website, Laura expects to quickly understand who he is, what programming languages and technologies he knows, and what type of mindset he has as a computer engineering student. She appreciates when a portfolio conveys both technical skills and a personal touch through a modern, interactive interface.

This website aims to give users like Laura a pleasant and engaging experience, combining a minimalist yet creative visual design with an easy-to-navigate structure. The goal is to make visitors feel that Ian is a motivated, curious, and modern computer engineering student who presents his work in a fresh and professional way.
